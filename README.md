# 2048 Game

This is my personal approach of the popular game [_2048_](https://2048game.com/). The implementation is realized in C and with some help from the ncurses library for the interface.

## HOW TO PLAY: 

Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!
